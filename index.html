<h2>Finding Points of Interest via Statistics</h2>
<p>In this chapter, Cairo describes how data visualizations can be used to find interesting patterns within the data. This first 
involves using statistics to find trends that could prove illuminating when displayed by the proper visualization. For example, he 
talks about using averages (mean, median, and mode) to create a baseline that can be used to put outliers into context. Median and 
mode are resistant statistics, meaning that outliers have a minimal effect on them. Mean on the other hand is greatly affected by 
outliers, so comparing all three values can highlight outliers in a single direction. This is only one example of how statistical 
analysis can be used as a starting point. Other characteristics such as distribution and standard deviation can also be used in the 
same way.

<h2>Highlighting those Points of Interest</h2>
<p>
Once you have found something that is worth looking at more in-depth, the next step is choosing the visualization that will give you 
the best information. Earlier in the chapter, Cairo used the example of North Carolina geography graduates, and their $738,428 mean 
salary. Of course, this is due to the extreme outlier that is Michael Jordanâ€™s basketball career. Imagine a similar situation where a 
relatively small range is expanded by a few extreme outliers. In this case, a box plot would give you a good representation of the 
data, as the outliers are represented along with the rest of the data. For this example, that box plot might look something like this:
